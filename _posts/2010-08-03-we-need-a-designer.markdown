# {{page.title}}

It's been a while since this site's been updated, it didn't help that we all forgot the account password! Our little groups been a rather quiet for some time but no more! At the last couple of meetings we saw several new faces (welcome guys), we've even broken records and had our biggest meeting ever, yes thats right we've hit double figures. So now that everyone's fired up and full of the joys of summer we're looking to relaunch this site with a bunch of new features. And thats why...

![we need you](/images/we-need-you.jpg)

We're looking for a someone that would be willing to donate a bit of time to design our new site (not this one). We'll supply you with plenty of beer, cake and thanks in lieu of any monetary compensation and of course give you full credit on the site. It would be a good opportunity for anyone looking at working with Ruby on Rails that would like some help getting started as we'll be able to supply you with our combined knowledge and expertise to get you into Rails in record time ;)

If this is something that sounds appealing to you please get in touch via the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/bristol-ruby) or @message me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/kernowsoul)
