The tenth meeting of the Bristol Ruby User Group is scheduled for 6:30pm on Thu 29 Oct at [Beef Towers](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=102259160340464042766.000475e709a489f460878&ll=51.443048,-2.569079&spn=0.000945,0.002245&t=h&z=19), Unit 1.10, Paintworks, Bristol, BS4 3EH. On the Bath Road about a mile SE of Bristol Temple Meads station.

We have three (count 'em) talks this month:

* [Stephen England](http://twitter.com/stephenengland) on [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)
* [Theo Cushion](http://twitter.com/theozaurus) and [Jamie Dyer](http://twitter.com/kernowsoul) on [Wuzlr](http://wuzlr.com)
* [Nicolas Alpi](http://twitter.com/spyou) on [Planet Toaster](http://www.planettoaster.com/)
  _Seems like http://planettoaster.com is down at the moment but you can read [Nic's blog post about it](http://www.notgeeklycorrect.com/ruby-on-rails/2009/08/25/more-about-the-railsrumble-and-planettoaster-com/)_

Wuzlr and Planet Toaster both being entries for this year's [Rails Rumble](http://r09.railsrumble.com/entries).

After the talks we will retire to the [Bocabar](http://www.paintworksbristol.co.uk/index.php?id=6).
